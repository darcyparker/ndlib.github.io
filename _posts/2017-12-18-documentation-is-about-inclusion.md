While attending [Samvera Connect 2017][samvera_connect_2017], I had a brief conversation with Bess about documentation. And her words - "Documentation is about inclusion" - stuck with me like a brainworm, challenging me.

Three years ago, I had a deep seeded resistance to documenting our community software development efforts. I justified this with rationalizations; the fluctuating technical details complicated and obviated the possibility of documenting technical implementations.

I failed to identify and advocate and give stronger support to calls for clearer design documents; statements of intention. We moved with "agility", teasing out pieces of the requirements moments before encoding those solutions in the code-base.

The documentation efforts seemed premature, reeking of a high probability of excessive rework of documentation. And we didn't have time for that; We were sprinting week after week to iterate on solutions.

As our team accumulated more and more "just in time" decisions, we began to lose a group understanding of why the systems behaved the way they did. Our prior intentions drifted into the dark recesses of oral tradition. Things "just were".

When bending and fighting code each day, the documentation seems unneeded. It becomes extra effort and something that I will likely invalidate. "I am the expert. The documentation is a poor approximation of the code." But without the documentation, the field of experts become limited to people that meet the following criteria:

1) Present since the in the beginning or Have significant capacity to ramp up
2) Continued contributions day after day

Those two points, highlight that without a culture of documentation, the core contributors census will diminish as people transition out of core contributions.

# A Path Forward

These days, I code less and less. I review code changes and their associated commit messages. Looking for the framing question of which the code changes are the answer. I want to know where I can find the "Why was this done?" document. Often times its in git commit messages (which is a great place to start). Other times, there are some specs that allude to intentions.

I also want to reiterate that it makes sense to sprint when your see your intended destination in front of you. Not as a matter of ritual.

Today, I write more and more documentation; APIs, sequence diagrams, decisions, policies, procedures, and guideliness. I have team members I need to onboard. I want to ensure that our necessary knowledge is not locked-away in my brain.

# Further Reflection

Documentation moves us forward as a community, city, state, country, and world.

Each document that you write projects forward in time your current understanding; Taking time to clarify both your intention and the context of your document improves its future usefulness. Be bold. And write as though your future self depended on it, because they do!
